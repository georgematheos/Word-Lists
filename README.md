# Word Lists

This is a web program which allows users to create lists of words, which may be later modified and viewed.  Though its functionality does not seem particularly useful, it is intended mostly as a test project to help me come to understand how to use various technologies and create an application of this sort.

For more information, including the specification for the server api and a list of todos, see the `info` directory.
