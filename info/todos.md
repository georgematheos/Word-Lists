### Yet to be done
- Decide what algorithm to use to create the password hash.
- Decide what form to use for dateCreated.
- Figure out how to work with Google (and maybe Facebook) accounts and create an api for this interaction.
- Do I want to change the API for modifying user data to use PATCH instead of PUT?
- Look into using promises?
- Find some way to get the server to return a 405 error when the wrong http verb is used for an existing route rather than a 404 error.
