### Yet to be done
- Style unrecognized path page and make it look better.
- Make it so error messages on the signup page can be longer and still work with the centering.
- Handle the situation in which a login or signup error occurs that is not in the switch statement (write the default behavior).
- Make it so the "Word Lists" title h1 is not absolutely positioned.
- Figure out how to work with Google (and maybe Facebook) accounts and create an api for this interaction.
