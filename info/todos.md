### Yet to be done
- Auto focus in word box after adding a word slot
- Alphabetize word lists?
- Tally number of word lists?
- Show a message at home screen if there are no word lists
- Show confirmation box before navigating away and maybe save changed before navigation as well.
- Animations for the confirm cancel/delete dialouge?
- Make sure that the username in the url is the same as the username of the signed in user for the home page and the list page
- Make the browser update the jwt periodically
- Should the browser check to make sure the server still thinks the jwt is valid periodically?
- Style unrecognized path page and make it look better.
- Make it so error messages on the signup page can be longer and still work with the centering.
- Handle the situation in which a login or signup error occurs that is not in the switch statement (write the default behavior).
- Figure out how to work with Google (and maybe Facebook) accounts and create an api for this interaction.
