### Yet to be done
- Change the way routing is done so that everything behaves in a logical way when one tries to go to the address "/list/not-logged-in-user" or "/list/user/non-existant-word-list"
- Refactor code so that list and home components are on a different ngmodule than the rest
- Make svgs into imported imgs
- Autosave periodically and before leaving the webpage rather than having the user save or cancel the changes.
- Make sure that the username in the url is the same as the username of the signed in user for the home page and the list page
- Make the browser update the jwt periodically
- Should the browser check to make sure the server still thinks the jwt is valid periodically?
- Style unrecognized path page and make it look better.
- Make it so error messages on the signup page can be longer and still work with the centering.
- Handle the situation in which a login or signup error occurs that is not in the switch statement (write the default behavior).
- Figure out how to work with Google (and maybe Facebook) accounts and create an api for this interaction.
