# The Plan

#### The app will take the form of a website through which a user can perform the following actions:
- Create a word list
- View all word lists he/she has already created
- View a word list he/she has already created
- Modify a word list he/she has already created
- Create an account
- Log into an account

#### The app will use the following technologies/methods to accomplish these things:
- Node.js for the server
- Typescript for parts (some will be very javascript-looking typescript since I started writing the backend with javascript and I will probably not rewrite all of it)
- Google's API so users can log in with a Google account (perhaps also using a Facebook account, or other services).  It will also be possible for users to create an account specific to this website.
- Tokens to authenticate users.
- Express.js for the server, as well
- SCSS (or SASS?) for styling the website
